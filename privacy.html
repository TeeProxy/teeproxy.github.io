    <h1>Privacy Policy - Tee</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Tee is a proxy application (Socks5 and Tuic) designed to provide network connection services. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled in Tee.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Tee itself does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>2. Network Data</h2>
    <p>The App requires network access to provide proxy functionality. While the App processes network data (such as IP addresses and ports) to establish connections, this information is not stored or logged on any server by us.</p>

    <h2>3. Firebase Services</h2>
    <p>Tee uses Firebase services including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
      <li>Firebase Crashlytics (NDK)</li>
      <li>Firebase Performance Monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may collect **anonymous technical information** such as crash reports, performance metrics, device model, OS version, and IP addresses. This data is used solely for improving app stability, performance, and user experience. Tee does not access or use this data for other purposes.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of Firebase Analytics by following instructions provided in your device settings or using Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en" target="_blank">opt-out tools</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Tee is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that data from a child has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests only the permissions necessary to provide proxy and network functionality. No additional sensitive user data is accessed.</p>

    <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Users are encouraged to review it periodically.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
